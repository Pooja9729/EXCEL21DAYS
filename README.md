Excel learning and practising
Day 1 & Day 2: employee details - Analysed data, cleaned data, noticed missing data, aligned with table and made it easily readable.
Missing values in the data sets(i.e, Name,, Email id, Country, Gender, Rating, Deparment).
Data set is clean and Readable(Bold, Color, Alignment).
DOUBT : I observed many duplicate names but they have unique employee id- should i remove duplicate names or keep it as it is?
